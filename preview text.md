In this preview for my visual argument, I have a basic white background, however it is a cloth material which adds some texture to the image. 
Originally I was going to use just a plain white or black background, but I decided that for the layering and overall idea of the image, one with texture would look better. 
It adds depth to the image. In addition to this, on the right I have a stack of multiple jeans. This is supposed to represent the ending product, the clothes. 
Everyone owns a pair of jeans, (hopefully), so this is a product that every single person can relate to buying, owning and wearing. 
I used the different color blues to pop out from the white background and the difference in textures can easily indicate difference in layers. 
In the top left, we can see text that reads, "What do your clothes cost?". I think this is going to be my sentence or use of text because it can mean multiple different things. 
In simpler terms, the phrase could simply mean the price of whatever the person is buying. If we begin to think more about this phrase, we start to image how we got the jeans or the other piece of clothing. 
Did they come from a factory? Who made these jeans? What materials were used to make these? Are there any environmental effects this process had? Are they really worth it?
My overall idea is to make the reader think about the journey that their articles of clothing go on. A lot of harmful repercussions can happen from making a single pair of pants.
I think for the future, I am going to try and fix that font and play around with it, fix the overall flow because it is a little wonky right now. 
I am also going to make an idea of a "supply chain" to the left of the stack of jeans, representing what could possibly go into these pants. 
This will included icons of factories, harmful ingredients, pollution, and things like that. I think I actually might want to include a statistic somewhere at the bottom, which would add to my point. 
Overall, I think this is developing pretty well so far and I am excited to see how I can truly create my idea.
